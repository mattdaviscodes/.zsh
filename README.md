# ZSH Configs

This project consolidates all zsh configs into a single directory with a logical structure. It provides a place to put sensitive configs which are not appropriate for public version control.

## Quick Start
This project should be cloned directly into your home directory. Then:

```zsh
cd .zsh
chmod +x setup.zsh
./setup.zsh
```
